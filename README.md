# Nutmeg

Nutmeg is a pre-alpha project. It's a docket manager for patent attorneys. I'm mostly making it for myself because I don't like the options that are available. 

Built using Qt 6.8. Compile with Clang or Visual C++. Doesn't work with gcc because I use __declspec-style properties for convenience.
